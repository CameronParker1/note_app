# Overview

This is a Note App written in Kotlin. The program will let you create new notes, edit them, delete them, or view all of them. 
As a software engineer I am trying to learn new skills, languages, and expand my knowledge. My purpose for writing this was to learn the syntax of 
Kotlin and write some simple beginner code. This program implements using variables, functions, and classes.
